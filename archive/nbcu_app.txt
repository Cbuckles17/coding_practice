Coding project: Colin Buckley


Specifications
Goal

Build a mobile application that displays the news


Data

https://s3.amazonaws.com/shrekendpoint/news.json

This contains a JSON data feed with a variety of news items, namely `article`s, `video`s and `slideshow`s (which contain `images` arrays) 


User Stories
- I want to be able to consume the news in various ways (which correspond to the `type`s you‚Äôll see in our data):
    - When I‚Äôm on the go, I‚Äôll skim all the headlines.
    - When I have time at night, I‚Äôll read `article`s,
    - When I want something visual on the train, I‚Äôll browse photo `slideshow`s
    - When I‚Äôm cooking dinner, I‚Äôll watch `video`s
- I want to see the freshest content (never show old news!)


Technical Requirements/Expectations
- Please implement this using the latest supported language for the platform:
    - iOS: Swift
    - Android: Kotlin
- We expect code that‚Äôs high quality and easy to read and understand
    - Here are our +Coding guidelines 
- Show milestones in your progress using git
    - We know you‚Äôre solo on this project, but please give us readable progress.  Everything dumped onto git as  ‚Äúinitial commit‚Äù the day before you submit isn‚Äôt ideal.


What we need from you
1. A proposal of scope and timeline


1. a summary of what you‚Äôd like to submit
2. when you want to start
3. a target date you‚Äôd like to submit.  

For timeline, we are flexible. You will be expected to show good estimation and communication. 

Send your proposal to Cheryl.Pieterse@nbcuni.com and Kevin.Lim@nbcuni.com with subject header ‚ÄúCoding project: `[insert your name]`‚Äù


2. A git repo URL, with the completed project

Once we receive this it may take us a couple of business days to review and get back to you with feedback. Our feedback may be a simple üëç or we may ask you to make some modifications before we say it‚Äôs done.




Common mistakes

By far the most common mistake is defining a scope too broad, creating too much work. The goal is not to build a full-fledged app. You don‚Äôt have to hit every user story, but you should show the best of your creativity, communication and coding

The next most common mistakes are: 

- disappearing and not making any time for communication. quality work at the end doesn‚Äôt offset the pain of bad coordination.
- submitting something that‚Äôs a Frankenstein monster of sample code. We need to see your authorship
